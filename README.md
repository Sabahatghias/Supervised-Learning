# Supervised-Learning
ðŸ”¹ 1. Decision Tree in Python
This notebook showcases the use of a Decision Tree Classifier for a supervised learning task. The project involves training the model, visualizing the tree, and interpreting splits based on feature importance. It's structured for binary or multi-class classification using scikit-learn.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Logistic Regression in Python
Implements Logistic Regression for classification problems using Python. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, and predictions. Performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Performance Measurements
Focuses on evaluating classification models using performance metrics and handling imbalanced datasets. Techniques used include:

ROC Curve & AUC

SMOTE for synthetic oversampling of minority class

Confusion matrix and classification report

This notebook provides a full evaluation pipeline suitable for binary classification problems with imbalanced classes.
